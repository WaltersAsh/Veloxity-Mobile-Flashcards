# Veloxity-Mobile-Flashcards
2018 NCEA Level 3 Digital Technology Project

## Outline
A three-part project consisting of brief development, conceptual design and prototyping that I worked on during my last year of high school in 2018.
Veloxity Mobile Flashcards was an app concept that was brought forward as a solution to revise notes for examinations.
The goal of this project was to learn the methodology of agile development represented by the following completed achievement standards and objectives: 

### AS91608 - Undertake brief development to address an issue within a determined context
- Undertook comprehensive brief development to address an issue within a determined context
- Developed a brief for an educational app for students to utilise on a mobile device.
- Justified why the specifications allow a judgement of an outcome’s fitness for purpose in the broadest sense
- Provided evidence of further ongoing reflection of context considerations and wider stakeholder feedback

### AS91610 - Develop a conceptual design considering fitness for purpose in the broadest sense
- Developed a justified conceptual design considering fitness for purpose in the broadest sense
- Synthesised evidence from ongoing research and functional modelling, including feedback from stakeholders, to substantiate the potential of the proposed outcome to meet the brief.
- Created a brief and proposed a mobile application for students wanting to revise quickly for examinations
- Synthesised evidence exemplified by basic wireframes on potential layouts, a brainstorm of features and designs, and analysis on existing solutions and differentiations to the proposed solution
- Substantiated the potential of the proposed outcome to meet the brief

### AS91611 - Develop a prototype considering fitness for purpose in the broadest sense
- Developed and justified prototype considering fitness for purpose in the broadest sense
- Synthesised evidence from ongoing testing (included prototyping) and stakeholder feedback to optimise the prototype and justify the prototype’s fitness for purpose against the brief
- Developed a prototype of a mobile application for students wanting to revise quickly for examinations
- Showed the synthesis of ongoing testing, including prototyping and some of the stakeholder feedback, to optimise the prototype and justify its fitness for purpose against the     brief
- Provided evidence of stakeholder feedback throughout the trialling of the prototype

## Creation Process
Veloxity Mobile Flashcards aimed to be a modern app that was stylish, swift, and simple. A prototype was achieved by learning and researching user interfaces. Emphasis on graphic design was also required, Adobe Photoshop and XD were used to achieve this.
